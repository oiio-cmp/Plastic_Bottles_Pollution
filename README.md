# Prediction Of Plastic Bottles Pollution With Linear Regression

## Executive Summary
The project aims to predict trends in plastic bottle litter from major manufacturers using a linear regression model. Sourced from Kaggle dataset ([URL link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wastebase/country-of-manufacture-vs-detection/output?scriptVersionId=188923245)) was selected for its sufficient amount of records and its linkage to specific manufacturers, enabling a focused analysis of plastic waste trends.
Initial findings unsurprisingly indicate Coca-Cola with the highest projected increase in plastic bottle waste
in the next two years w. Overall, the trends show consistent growth in plastic waste across all manufacturers, signalling an upward trajectory in plastic bottle littering unless serious interventions are implemented.
